# PIZZAMOTO Project.

The project is an online website for the user to build his or her own pizza. A user is shown the menu in high definition images and from the items and prices on the menu the user can then build their pizza of choice and then place and order giving input of their phone number and place of delivery and then receive a message back that their order is being processed and will be delivered to the said area.
